# 1. Built-in LED

In this example I just control the built-in LED of the RP2040-ETH chip

# 2. Configure the CH9120 chip

In this example I created a boot.py and used the provided ch9120.py library from the official <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-ETH">waveshare wiki</a> to initial the ch9120 serial to ethernet converter as a TCP server.

# 3. Modbus RTU over TCP (encapsulated)
