To try the examples you first need to install a micropython firmware to your board.
Please look <a href="https://github.com/nichokap/RP2040-ETH/tree/main/MicroPython%20Firmware">here</a>

# 1. Built-in LED

In this example I just control the built-in LED of the RP2040-ETH chip

# 2. Configure the CH9120 chip

In this example I created a boot.py and used the provided ch9120.py library from the official <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-ETH">waveshare wiki</a> to initialize the ch9120 serial to ethernet converter as a TCP server.

# 3. Control built-in LED though TCP
In this example the RP2040-ETH is programmed 

# 4. Modbus RTU over TCP (encapsulated)
