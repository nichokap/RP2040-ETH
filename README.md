Given that the documentation related to this microcontroller is very limited and that the integrated ethernet chip ch... is not common and quite limited in functions (can be used as a TCP/UDP server/client only) I am sharing my personal examples to help other get used to it.

I am using MicroPython for my projects on this controller.
