# PR2040-ETH
Personal projects on Waveshare RP2040-ETH

I tried this powerful and cheap microcontroller to implement simple projects. 

Given that the documentation related to this microcontroller is very limited and that the integrated ethernet chip ch... is not common and quite limited in functions (can be used as a TCP/UDP server/client only) I am sharing my personal examples to help other get used to it.

I am using MicroPython on this controller.
