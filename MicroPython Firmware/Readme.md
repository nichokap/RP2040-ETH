For my projects, I am using the official Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython firmware 20240222-v1.22.2 downloaded from <a href="https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/rp2-pico-latest.uf2">here</a>.

A copy of the UF2 file can be found on this folder.

Flashing instructions are available <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html">here</a>.
